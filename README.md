# WeatherBot
WeatherBot is a task planning app that suggests tasks based on the current weather in your area based on an input zipcode. Only works for US currently

First get a weather forecast and add tasks to your todo list. Todo list tasks are saved to a file, so it is isn't necessary to add tasks every time.
Then get suggestions on what to do based on the current weather, including both saved tasks and pregenerated ideas.
